# To-Do-List
To-do list project is an application specifically built to keep track of tasks that need to be done. This application will be like a task keeper where the user would be able to enter the tasks that they need to do. Once they are done with the task, they can either remove it from the list or can check the box before the task to know that they have completed this task.
